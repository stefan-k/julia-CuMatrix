This is a CUDA Matrix library for julia language

Getting Started:

Download
- git clone git@github.com/pavanky/julia-CuMatrix.git

Pre-Install
- Make sure you have the CUDA toolkit and driver installed on your system
- Open /path/to/julia-CuMatrix/cuplus/Makefile and point CUDADIR to your CUDA install path

Install
- cd /path/to/julia-CuMatrix/
- make -C cuplus clean
- make -C cuplus all

Post Install
- export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/julia-CuMatrix/:/path/to/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
- On 32 bit systems, use lib instead of lib64
- You will need to export LD_LIBRARY_PATH everytime you start a new terminal
- Alternatively you can add that line at the end of your .bashrc

You are good to go
